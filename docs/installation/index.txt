============
Installation
============

The Web interface is now separated from Domogik, into another project called DomoWeb

The mains reasons are:
- A different development cycle and more faster updates.
- More targeted and shorter tests campagnes.
- DomoWeb can be installed in a different computer than Domogik.

.. note:: DomoWeb does not support Domogik 0.1, please use a higher version.

Download Domoweb
================

Go on `Download <http://wiki.domogik.org/Download>`_ to get Domoweb.
You will get a file named **domoweb-<release>.tgz**. Download it and extract it: ::

    $ wget http://repo.domogik.org/...
    $ tar xvzf domoweb-<release>.tgz
    $ cd domoweb-<release>

Install the DomoWeb development release
================

Run the installation script :
.. note:: during installation, a new user will be created if necessary.

.. code-block:: bash
    $ cd domoweb
    $ sudo ./install.sh

You will be asked for the following questions : ::

    If you want to use a proxy, please set it now. It will only be used during the installation. (ex: http://1.2.3.4:8080)

During the installation, some python librairies could be downloaded. If you use a proxy, you must set it here.

.. code-block:: bash

    Which user will run DomoWeb, it will be created if it does not exist yet? (default : domogik)

System user that will launch DomoWeb. You should keep the default choice.

.. code-block:: bash

    You already have DomoWeb configuration files. Do you want to keep them ? [Y/n]

If you already have DomoWeb configuration files, you will be asked for keeping them or not.

.. code-block:: bash

    Everything seems to be good, DomoWeb should be installed correctly.             
    I will start the test_config.py script to check it.                             
    Please press Enter when ready.

Just press enter to start the check script.

.. code-block:: bash

    ==> ================================================== <==                     
    ==>  Everything seems ok, you should be able to start  <==                     
    ==>       DomoWeb with /etc/init.d/domoweb start       <==                     
    ==>             or /etc/rc.d/domoweb start             <==                     
    ==> ================================================== <==

Installation is finished and seems to be OK.
